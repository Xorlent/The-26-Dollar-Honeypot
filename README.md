# The $26 Honeypot
The world's lowest cost honeypot appliance  

## Background
After completing the [$32 network environmental monitoring project](https://github.com/Xorlent/PoESP32-SNMP-Environmental-Monitor) and marveling at the miniscule cost and excellent packaging of the M5Stack PoESP32 device, I contemplated other applications where this device could provide value.  A network honeypot was the first thing that came to mind.

## Requirements
1. M5Stack [PoESP32 device](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/esp32-ethernet-unit-with-poe), currently $25.90 USD
2. A single [M5Stack ESP32 Downloader kit](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/esp32-downloader-kit), currently $9.95 USD
3. A Syslog collector

## Functional Description
This project produces a honeypot that listens on commonly targeted TCP ports.  If activity is detected, a Syslog (UDP) message is immediately sent with information about the source IP and port accessed.  The device is not remotely managable.  If you need to change any configuration details, a re-flash/re-programming is necessary:
- Host name
- Device IP address information
- DNS servers
- Syslog collector IP
- NTP server

## Programming
_Once you've successfully programmed a single unit, skip step 1.  Repeating this process takes 5 minutes from start to finish._
1. [Set up your Arduino programming environment](https://github.com/Xorlent/The-26-Dollar-Honeypot/blob/main/ARDUINO-SETUP.md)
2. Disassemble the PoESP32 case
   - You will need a 1.5 mm (M2) allen wrench to remove a single screw [pic](https://github.com/Xorlent/The-26-Dollar-Honeypot/blob/main/images/1-Allen.jpg)
   - Inserting a small flat head screwdriver into the slots flanking the Ethernet jack [pic](https://github.com/Xorlent/The-26-Dollar-Honeypot/blob/main/images/2-Slots.jpg), carefully separate the case halves; work it side by side to avoid damage [pic](https://github.com/Xorlent/The-26-Dollar-Honeypot/blob/main/images/3-Tabs.jpg)
3. In Arduino, open the project file (PoESP32-Honeypot.ino)
   - Edit the hostname, IP address, subnet, gateway, Syslog collector IP, and NTP server info at the very top of the file.
   - Select Tools->Board->esp32 and select "ESP32 Dev Module"
4. With the USB-to-serial adapter unplugged, insert the pins in the correct orientation on the back of the PoESP32 mainboard [pic](https://github.com/Xorlent/The-26-Dollar-Honeypot/blob/main/images/4-Programmer.jpg)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not plug the PoESP32 device into Ethernet until after step 7 or you risk damaging your USB port!
5. With light tension applied to ensure good connectivity to the programming through-hole vias on the PoESP32 (see step 4 pic), plug in the USB-to-serial adapter
   - The device is now in bootloader mode
6. In Arduino
   - Select Tools->Port and select the USB-to-serial adapter
     - If you're unsure, unplug the USB-to-serial adapter, look at the port list, then plug it back in and select the new entry (repeating step 5)
   - Select Sketch->Upload to flash the device
7. Disconnect the USB-to-serial adapter and reassemble the case
8. Connect the PoESP32 to a PoE network port and mount as appropriate
   - The holes in the PoESP32 case work great with zip ties for rack install or screws if attaching to a backboard
9. Configure your syslog alerts as appropriate
    - Add alert triggers based on events received from these devices to get immediate notice of possible malicious lateral movement

## Guidance and Limitations
- The device produces Syslog UDP messages in the BSD / RFC 3164 format.
- Listening TCP ports are user-configurable within the source file, with a few default personalities to choose from.
- There is no throttling mechanism in place.
  - The honeypot will attempt to send one message for every single connection attempt.
- It is recommended you exempt your honeypot IP addresses in any legitimate vulnerability or network scanners to avoid spam.
- The device will respond to pings (will not generate Syslog events) from any IP address within the routable network.
